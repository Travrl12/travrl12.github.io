## About Me

Hi, I'm Travis R. Lee—though in the cybersecurity world, I'm often known as **C1pherKn1ght**. I’m at the start of an exciting journey into **offensive security**, specifically **red teaming** and **penetration testing**. What excites me most about this field is the opportunity to think like an attacker, find vulnerabilities, and help organizations strengthen their defenses before any real threats emerge.

Beyond the tech world, I’m a family man, deeply rooted in my **faith**, and blessed to be surrounded by loved ones—including my two amazing dogs, who always keep life interesting! I also love spending time outdoors—whether it's **relaxing at the beach** or heading out on a hike, being in nature helps me recharge. Growing up, I played sports, and being part of a team has been a huge part of my life ever since. That teamwork mentality is something I bring with me into every project I work on.

For me, cybersecurity isn’t just about hacking systems—it's about **working together** to solve problems creatively, protecting what matters, and constantly pushing myself to learn and grow. Whether it's in my professional life or with my family, I'm always looking to make meaningful contributions and help others.
