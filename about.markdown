## About Me
Hello! I'm Travis R. Lee, also known as C1pherKn1ght, and I'm at the beginning of an exciting journey into the world of cybersecurity, with a focus on offensive security and red teaming.

### My Mission
My mission is to apply my growing expertise in offensive security to help organizations identify vulnerabilities and secure their digital assets. I am passionate about solving complex security challenges while leading and collaborating within a team. I am actively seeking to join a company that shares my commitment to teamwork, growth, and innovation in the cybersecurity space, where I can contribute to red teaming and penetration testing efforts while aligning with a culture of integrity and continuous improvement.

### My Skills
Here are the key skills I've gained from my training and work experience:
- **Python**: Developing scripts for automation and penetration testing.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Used for building and securing web applications.
- **Network Security Fundamentals**
- **Risk Assessment & Vulnerability Management**
- **SIEM Tools**: Experience in analyzing events and responding to security incidents.
- **Linux & SQL**
- **Incident Response**
- **Project Coordination & Leadership**

I am currently seeking opportunities to match with an **employer** who values hands-on cybersecurity skills and is looking for a dedicated professional eager to grow in offensive security.

### My Goals
While I’m still early in my career, I’m committed to continuous learning and developing the skills needed to become an effective part of a red team. I’m currently exploring:
- **Penetration testing** techniques and tools.
- **Offensive security methodologies** like social engineering and exploit development.
- **Cybersecurity fundamentals** to ensure a strong foundation.

### Why Offensive Security?
There’s something incredibly rewarding about understanding how systems can be exploited, not for malicious reasons, but to build stronger defenses. The offensive side of cybersecurity allows me to creatively solve problems, think critically, and always stay one step ahead of potential attackers.
