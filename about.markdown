## About Me

Hello! I'm Travis R. Lee, also known as C1pherKn1ght, and I'm at the beginning of an exciting journey into the world of cybersecurity, with a focus on offensive security and red teaming.

I recently earned my **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, which sparked my passion for exploring vulnerabilities and learning how to think like an attacker to strengthen defenses. Soon after, I joined **Hack The Box**, where I’ve been sharpening my skills through hands-on labs and challenges. Every challenge fuels my desire to become a proficient Red Team expert.

### My Goals

While I’m still early in my career, I’m committed to continuous learning and developing the skills needed to become an effective part of a red team. I’m currently exploring:

- **Penetration testing** techniques and tools.
- **Offensive security methodologies** like social engineering and exploit development.
- **Cybersecurity fundamentals** to ensure a strong foundation.

### Why Offensive Security?

There’s something incredibly rewarding about understanding how systems can be exploited, not for malicious reasons, but to build stronger defenses. The offensive side of cybersecurity allows me to creatively solve problems, think critically, and always stay one step ahead of potential attackers.
